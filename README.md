The purpose of this project was to learn by doing. Specifically around the node.js framework. 
This project had a web interface with mongoDB database. This project is no longer functional and will have to be hosted locally in order to work. 

I am making the deliberate choice not to choose a license for this project. This is not in an attempt to apply a wtfpl license but quite the opposite.
Default copyright licence meaning that other may not use, reproduce or apply my code.
