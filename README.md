This project had a web interface which was a login page and a user page. If a user with administrative power was logging in then it would show a page where one had a list of all other users. Administrative power also gave the user the ablity to delete and create new users.

This project was mainly meant as a way for me to get experience intregrating a web based front end and a mongoDB based back end. Most of the packages and the hosted location of the project are old/no longer available.
